	abstract = {We present a controller tuning strategy for first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) processes where the time delay in the model is approximated using the Pad{\textbackslash}'e function. Using Routh-Hurwitz stability analysis, we derive the gain that will give rise to desirable PID controller settings. The resulting PID controller, now correctly tuned, produces satisfactory closed-loop behavior and stabilizes the first-order plant. Our proposed technique eliminates the deadtime component in the model and results in a minimum-phase system with all of its poles and zeros in the left-half s-plane. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present control simulation results from an in-depth performance comparison between our technique and other established model-based strategies used for the control of time-delayed systems. These results prove that, for the FOPTD model, Pad{\textbackslash}'e approximation eliminates the undesirable effects of the time delay and promises a faster tracking performance superior to conventional controllers.},
